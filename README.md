# The-Terminal
A launcher for all applications I've created or bundled and include many games and apps. It's just something I like to work on in my spare time, but doesn't mean I'll fully abandon it! Again this is just a simple program for fun. All the menus and most apps are in Batch and compiled into an exe. So try it out!
